# Whale Identification Model

## Project Proposal

### a. A clear description of the topic.
Nowadays, whale is really rare and protecting whale is necessary. Different species of whales have different features in their shape of tails and special markings. Thus, in many cases, scientists monitor whalesâ€™ activities by using photos of their tails. To help scientists confirm the species of different whales in huge number of photos and save their time, we aim to build a new machine learning model to do this instead of persons.


### b. Background research of related work.
#### b(1)    ALEXNET
An ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Networks, widely used in neural learning area. In 2012, CNN used to achieve test error rate of 15.4%, nearly half of the best work before. This technology totally used ReLU for the nonlinearity functions and data augmentation technology consisting image translations, horizontal reflections, and patch extractions.

#### b(2)    YOLO
YOLO(You look only once) is a real-time object detection system, they apply the model to an image at multiple locations and scales. High scoring regions of the image are considered detections. It provided a pre-trained model for users to figure out the object from a photo in different size.

### c. Data sources.
Most of datas comes from Happy Whale, a platform which already use image process algorithms to receive



### d. What algorithms are being used and code sources.


### e. Project timeline
2018.1.26 - 2018.2.9 Project preparation(Learning deep-learning and machine learning fundamental technology)
2018.2.9 - 2018.3.11 Confirm the main method and create the main frame of thesis
